### File and directory commands
1. **pwd** The pwd(Present Working Directory) command is used to print the name of the present/current working directory starting from the root.
   ```bash
   $ pwd
   /home/sj/Desktop/Linux
   ```
2. **mkdir** The mkdir(make directory) command allows users to create directories or folders.
   ```bash
   $ mkdir ubuntu
   $ ls
   ubuntu
   ```
   The option '-p' is used to create multiple directories or parent directories at once.
   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3
   $ cd dir1/dir2/dir3
   ~/Desktop/Linux/dir1/dir2/dir3$
   ```

3. **rmdir**: The rmdir(remove directories) is used to remove *empty* directories. Can be used to delete multiple empty directories as well. Safer to use compared to `rm -r FolderName`. This command can also be forced to delete non-empty directories.
   1. Remove empty directory:
   ```bash
   rmdir FolderName
   ```
   2. Remove multiple directories:
   ```bash
   rmdir FolderName1 FolderName2 FolderName3
   ```
   3. Remove non-empty directories:
   ```bash
   rmdir FolderName1 --ignore-fail-on-non-empty
   ```
   4. Remove entire directory tree. This command is similar to `rmdir a/b/c a/b a`:
   ```bash
   rmdir -p a/b/c
   ```

4. **rm**: The rm(remove) command is used to  remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links etc from the file system.
   1. Remove file: The rm command is used to remove or delete a file
   ```bash
   rm file_name
   ```
   2. Remove file forcefully: The rm command with -f option is used for removal of file without prompting for confirmation.
   ```bash
   rm -f filename
   ```
   3. Remove directory: The rm command with -r option is used to remove the directory and its contents recursively.
   ```bash
   rm -r myDir
   ```
   4. Remove directory forcefully: The rm command with -rf option is used to forcefully remove directory recursively.
   ```bash
   rm -rf myDir
   ```
5. **touch**: The touch command is is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file without any content.
   1. Create a new file: You can create a single file at a time using touch command. The file created is an empty file.
   ```bash
   touch file_name
   ```
   2. Create multiple files: You can create the multiple numbers of files at the same time.
   ```bash
   touch file1_name file2_name file3_name
   ```
   3. Change access time: The touch command with `a` option is used to change the access time of a file.
   ```bash
   touch -a file_name
   ```
   4. Change modification time: The touch command with `m` option is used to change the modified time.
   ```bash
   touch -m file_name
   ```
   5. Use timestamp of other file: The touch command with `r` option is used to get timestamp of another file.
   ```bash
   touch -r file2 file1
   ```
   In the above example, we get the timestamp of file1 for file2.
   6. Create file with Specific time: The touch command with 't' option is used to create a file with specified time.
   ```bash
   touch -t 1911010000 file_name
   ```
6. **cat**: The cat command is used to create single or multiple files, view contain of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files.
   1. View file contents: You can view contents of a single or more files by mentioning the filenames.
   ```bash
   cat file_name1 file_name2
   ```

### SSH

   SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that enables secure remote connections between two systems.

   1. **Connect remote machine using IP address or machine name:** The remote server can be connected with local user name using either host name or IP address

   ```cmd
   ssh <host-name> or <ip-address>

   Example:
   ssh 192.111.66.100
   ssh test.remoteserver.com
   ```

   2. **Connect remote machine using username:** It is also possible specify a user for an SSH connection.

   ```cmd
   ssh username@hostname_or_ip-address

   Example:
   ssh john@192.0.0.22
   ssh john@test.remoteserver.com
   ```

   3. **:Connect remote machine using custom port** By default, the SSH server listens for a connection on port 22. But you can also specify the custom port.

   ```cmd
   ssh <host-name> or <ip-address> -p port_number

   Example:
   ssh test.remoteserver.com -p 3322
   ```

   4. **Generate SSH keys using keygen:** SSH Keygen is used to generate a key pair which consists of public and private keys to improve the security of SSH connections.

   ```cmd
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

   5. **Copying SSH keys to servers:** For SSH authentication, `ssh-copy-id` command will be used to copy public key(id_rsa.pub) to server.

   ```cmd
   ssh-copy-id hostname_or_IP
   ```

   6. **Copy a File Remotely over SSH:** SCP tool is used to securely copy files over the SSH protocol.

   ```cmd
   scp fileName user@remotehost:destinationPath

   Example:
   scp test.txt test@10.0.0.64:/home/john/Desktop
   ```

   7. **Edit SSH Config File** SSH server options customized by editing the settings in `sshd_config` file.

   ```cmd
   sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

   8. **Run commands on a remote server** SSH commands can be executed on remote machine using the local machine.

   ```cmd
   ssh test.remoteserver.com mkdir NewDirectoryName // Creating directory on remote machine
   ```

   9. **Restart SSH service:** You need to restart the service in Linux after making changes to SSH configuration.

   ```cmd
   sudo ssh service restart
   (or)
   sudo sshd service restart
   ```

### Vi/Vim-commands

   Vi editor is the most popular text editor from the early days of Unix. Whereas Vim(Vi IMproved) is an improved version of vi editor to be used in CLI (command line interface) for mainly text editing tasks in many configuration files. Some of the other alternatives are Elvis, Nvi, Nano, Joe, and Vile.
   It has two main operation modes,

   1. **Command Mode:** It allows the entry of commands to manipulate text.
   2. **Entry mode(Or Insert mode):** It allows typed characters on the keyboard into the current file.

#### 1. Start with Vi Editor

   You can create a new file or open an existing file using `vi filename` command.
   ```cmd
    vi <filename_NEW> or <filename_EXISTING> // Create a new file or open an existing file

    Example:
    vi first.txt
   ```
   Let's see how do you create file, enter the content and leave the CLI by saving the changes.
   1. Create a new file named `first.txt`
   2. Press `i` to enter the insert mode
   3. Enter the text "Hello World!"
   4. Save the text and exit by pressing `:wq!` command
   5. Check the entered text

#### 2. Cursor movement
    These commands will be used in Command mode.

##### Move cursor
   You can use arrow keys(left, right, up and down) to move the cursor on the terminal. But you can also other keys for this behavior.
   ```cmd
    h        # Move left
    j        # Move down
    k        # Move up
    l        # Move right
   ```
##### Jump one word
   These commands used to jump one word at a time
   ```cmd
   w        # Jump forwards to the start of a word
   W        # Jump forwards to the start of a WORD
   e        # Jump forwards to the start of a word
   E        # Jump forwards to the start of a WORD
   b        # Jump backwords to the start of a word
   B        # Jump backwords to the start of a WORD
   ```

##### Jump to start or end of a line or next line
   These commands used to jump starting or ending of a line or a next line.
   ```cmd
   ^        # Jump to the start of a current line
   $        # Jump to the end of a current line
   return   # Jump to the start of a next line
   ```
##### Move sides
   These commands used to moves all sides of the screen
   ```cmd
   Backspace # Move cursor one character to the left
   Spacebar  # Move cursor one character to the right
   H(High)   # Move cursor to the top of the screen
   M(Middle) # Move cursor to the middle of the screen
   L(Low)    # Move cursor to the bottom of the screen
   ```

##### Paging and Scrolling
   Paging is used to moves the cursor up or down through the text a full screen at a time. Whereas Scrolling happens line by line.
   ```cmd
   Ctrl + f     # move forward one full screen
   Ctrl + b     # move backward one full screen
   Ctrl + d     # move forward half a screen
   Ctrl + u     # move backward half a screen
   ```

##### Inserting Text
   These commands places vi in entry mode from command mode. First, you need to be in command mode to use the below commands.
###### Insert
   ```cmd
   i    # Insert text to the left of the cursor
   I    # Insert text at the beginning of a line
   ESC  # Exit insert mode
   ```
###### Append
   ```cmd
   a    # Insert(or Append) text to the right of the cursor
   A    # Insert(or Append) text at the end of a line
   ```
###### Open a line
   ```cmd
   o    # Open a line below the current cursor position
   O    # open a line above the current cursor position
   ```
##### Editing Text

##### Deleting Text

##### Cut, Copy & Paste

##### Exiting
    These commands are used to exit from the file.
    ```cmd
    :w	    # Write (save) the file, but don't exit
    :wq	    # Write (save) and quit
    :wq!	# Force write (save) and quit
    :q	    # Quit, but it fails if anything has changed
    :q!	    # Quit and throw away for any changes
    ```
